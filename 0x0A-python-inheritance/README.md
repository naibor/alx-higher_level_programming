###### 7-base_geometry.py, tests/7-base_geometry.txt
- A class BaseGeometry (based on 6-base_geometry.py).
    - Public instance method: def area(self): that raises an Exception with the message area() is not implemented
    - Public instance method: def integer_validator(self, name, value): that validates value:
        - you can assume name is always a string
        - if value is not an integer: raise a TypeError exception, with the message <name> must be an integer
        - if value is less or equal to 0: raise a ValueError exception with the message <name> must be greater than 0
    - You are not allowed to import any module

###### 8-rectangle.py
